# Project
# Number Guesser 🎯

This is a simple Python game where the player guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 🔧 Features
- Random number generation
- User input with feedback (Too high / Too low)
- Win counter

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to practice using loops, conditionals, and random numbers in Python. I love building interactive programs that respond to the user.

## 🚀 Try It Out
You can run it live on Replit: [Run the project](https://replit.com/@YourUsername/number-guesser)

## 📚 What I Learned
- Using `random.randint()`
- While loops and input handling
- Basic debugging and testing

## 🛠 Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels
- Add a restart/play again feature
